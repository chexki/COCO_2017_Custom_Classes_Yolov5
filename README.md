# COCO_2017_Custom_Classes_Yolov5
Coco 2017 data Manipulation and Formatting to obtain required classes for Yolo V5.

Objectives - 
It gets quite challenging to get enough data to train Object Detection Models on, Even the available data's comes with less or more classes which are not required for the exercise.
To tackle this problem, their should be some mechanism which will allow user to pick classes as per requirement and streamline the process of data collection once and for all.
With the same aim here I'm trying to solve most basic hurdle that one may face in such scenario's.
